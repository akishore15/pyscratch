Hello, and welcome to the PyScratch library. This is a tool that (probably) allows you to use Python and probably just chill and learn Python. It was intended to be a Scratch Modification, but the idea has mutated into a whole new idea. You can find a majority of the files posted on GitHub. But, you can also do a few tons of load just using the PyScratch module itself. If you are a linux user, go to the "pyrun-for-linux.sh" file and run it on the command line. If you are using Windows, open the "pyrun-for-windows.json" and just put all the code in a JSON IDE. For Mac, you can run a PHP file named by "pyrun-for-mac.php" and run it on a PHP IDE and run. If you want, you can just download all the files, but just use your associated "pyrun" code. If your operating system is not there, please send a complaint to "kiaravind15@proton.me" and me and my crew will fix it. If it is not there, do not worry as we have probably not caught up with you as we had a storm in the city of Bellevue in the state of Washington and we cannot guarantee we'll get to you in a day or two, but we will defenitely respond if you add "PYSCRATCH COMPLAINT" and we will come to you in a few days or weeks. Once we reply, we will have fixed the emergency, I can assure you that.
